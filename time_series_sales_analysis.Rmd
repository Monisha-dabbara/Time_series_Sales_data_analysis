# **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Report**

## Introduction
This report presents an analysis of a time series dataset representing monthly product sales from January 2015 to December 2024. The primary objective is to identify and fit the most appropriate time series models, with a specific focus on forecasting sales for the period from January to June 2025, while also providing prediction intervals to assess the reliability of these forecasts. 

The analysis explores three different approaches: ARIMA, time-series regression, and dynamic linear models (DLM). Each method undergoes an iterative process involving model identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking to ensure accuracy. The results of these models are then compared to determine the most suitable method for reliable and effective forecasting of future sales.

## Model Identification and Fitting

### Data Preparation
The dataset comprises five columns, each representing a different dataset. For this analysis, dataset 3 (column 3) is selected. The data consists of 120 monthly observations.

```{r,include=FALSE}
library(astsa)
library(datasets)
library(forecast)
library(tseries)
library(dlm)
```

```{r}
# Load and extract dataset
filename <- "projectdata.txt"
data <- read.table(filename, header = FALSE)
y <- data[, 3]
str(y)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Visualize data
time_series <- ts(y, start = c(2015, 1), frequency = 12)
plot(time_series, main = "Monthly Sales (2015-2024)", ylab = "Sales", xlab = "Year",lw=2)
```

An additive model is appropriate because the magnitudes of seasonal fluctuations remain consistent over time. The data exhibits a general upward trend over the years, reflecting steady growth. Recurring seasonal patterns are evident, supporting the use of an additive model to capture these variations effectively.

First-order and seasonal differencing were applied to remove trends and seasonality, as demonstrated in below figure.
```{r}
# Apply differencing to remove trend and seasonality
diff_ts <- diff(diff(time_series, lag = 12)) # Seasonal differencing
plot(diff_ts, main = "Seasonally Differenced Data", ylab = "Differenced Values",
xlab = "Time", col = "purple", lw = 2)

# ACF and PACF plots
acf(diff_ts, main = "ACF of Differenced Data",lag.max = 1000)
pacf(diff_ts, main = "PACF of Differenced Data",lag.max = 1000)

```
```{r}
# Hypothesis: Mean of differenced series is equal to 0
t_test_result <- t.test(diff_ts, mu = 0)

# Print the result
print(t_test_result)
```
The t-test results indicate that seasonal differencing successfully removed trends and seasonality, resulting in a stationary series with a mean close to zero. The ACF plot shows significant spikes at lower lags before tapering off, suggesting the need for both autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms for further modeling, such as ARIMA.

### ARIMA Modeling

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a powerful tool for modeling and forecasting time series data. It consists of three components, AutoRegressive (AR) which captures relationships between current and past values; Integrated (I), which uses differencing to achieve stationarity; and Moving Average (MA), which accounts for dependencies on past forecast errors. Together, these components allow ARIMA to effectively model trends, seasonality, and noise in time series data.

```{r}
(model_ar<-arima(time_series,order=c(1,1,0),seasonal=c(0,1,0)))
```
```{r}
##Extract residuals
resids=model_ar$residuals
##Plot residuals as a time series

##Plot acf and pacf

```
```{r}
(model_sma<-arima(time_series,order=c(0,1,0),seasonal=c(0,1,1)))
```

```{r}
##Extract residuals

```

```

Several ARIMA models were tested to identify the best fit. The table below summarizes the key features of each model, including the AR and MA coefficients, log-likelihood, AIC values, and a brief evaluation of the residuals:

| **Model**                          | **AR Terms**                  | **MA Terms**        | **Seasonal MA Terms**  | **Log-Likelihood** | **AIC**   | **Residuals Behavior**                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARIMA(1,1,0) Seasonal(0,1,0)**   | AR(1) = -0.3685               | None                | None                   | -373.13            | 750.26    | Residuals exhibited some autocorrelation, suggesting room for improvement.                                    |
| **ARIMA(0,1,0) Seasonal(0,1,1)**   | None                          | None                | SMA(1) = -0.7490       | -359.43            | 722.85    | Residuals improved, but some autocorrelation remained, showing a better fit than the first model.           |
| **ARIMA(1,1,0) Seasonal(0,1,1)**   | AR(1) = -0.3903               | None                | SMA(1) = -0.8528       | -351.21            | 708.42    | Residuals showed significant improvement with fewer autocorrelations. This model provided the best fit.      |
| **ARIMA(2,1,0) Seasonal(0,1,1)**   | AR(1) = -0.3910, AR(2) = -0.0019 | None               | SMA(1) = -0.8527       | -351.21            | 710.42    | Residuals slightly improved, but AIC was slightly higher, indicating no substantial gain in fit.             |

Both ARIMA(1,1,0) with Seasonal(0,1,1) and ARIMA(2,1,0) with Seasonal(0,1,1) were found to provide a good fit based on residual analysis and ACF/PACF patterns. 

To further evaluate the models, the **`sarima()`** function is used to perform additional diagnostics and assess the fit more thoroughly (see below).

```{r}
model_sarima <- sarima(time_series, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12)
```

The model **ARIMA(1,1,0)(0,1,1)[12]** identified as the best fit, as it demonstrated high p-values in the Ljung-Box test, indicating no significant autocorrelation in the residuals, and all coefficient p-values were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### Time-Series Regression Modeling

A time-series regression model is applied to the data, incorporating both a linear time trend and seasonal factors as predictors. 

```{r}
# Residual analysis
time = c(1:120)
season = gl(12,1,120)
fit = lm(time_series~time+season)
```

The model showed a strong fit, with an R-squared value of 0.988 and an adjusted R-squared value of 0.987, indicating that the model explains the vast majority of the variation in the data.

The fitted values overlaid on the original time series to visually assess the model's performance. The plot of monthly sales from 2015 to 2024 shows that the model captures both the trend and seasonal patterns effectively, with the fitted line closely following the observed data. This highlights the model's accuracy in representing the underlying structure of the time series (shown below).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
fitted = ts(fitted.values(fit),start=c(2015,1),
frequency=12)
plot(time_series, 
     main = "Regression fit model of Sales (2015-2024)", lw=2)

lines(fitted,col=2., lty=2, lw=3)
```

The residuals from the time-series regression model are analyzed to evaluate the model's fit. The residual plot below shows no discernible patterns, indicating that the model effectively captures the underlying data structure.

```{r}
resid <- ts(residuals(fit), start = c(2015, 1), frequency = 12)
plot(resid, main = "Residuals", ylab = "Residual Values", xlab = "Time", col = "black", lw = 2)
acf(resid, main = "ACF of Residuals")
pacf(resid, main = "PACF of Residuals")
```

As illustrated in the plots above, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the residuals gradually diminishes, suggesting that no significant autocorrelation remains in the data. The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) exhibits a distinct cutoff after a lag of 2, implying that an AR(2) model may be suitable for capturing any remaining dependencies in the data.

The following ARIMA models were fitted: ARIMA(0,0,1), ARIMA(1,0,0), ARIMA(1,0,1), ARIMA(2,0,0), ARIMA(2,0,1), and ARIMA(3,0,0) (refer below). Among these, the ARIMA(2,0,1) model provided the best fit. The results for each model are summarized in the table below.

```{r}
(mod1=arima(resid,order=c(1,0,1),include.mean=FALSE))
```
```{r}
plot(mod1$residuals,ylab="residuals")
acf(mod1$residuals)
pacf(mod1$residuals)
```
```{r}
(mod2a=arima(resid,order=c(2,0,1),include.mean=FALSE))
```


```{r}
m1<-mod2a$loglik
m<- mod1$loglik
(diff_pvalue<- m1-m)
```


```{r}
1-pchisq(diff_pvalue,df=1)
```
| **Model**                  | **AR Terms**                              | **MA Terms**          | **SigmaÂ²** | **Log-Likelihood** | **AIC**  | **Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ARIMA(0,0,1)               | None                                      | MA(1) = 0.6965        | 119.00     | -457.34             | 918.69   | Poor fit, high sigmaÂ², and residuals exhibit significant autocorrelations. |
| ARIMA(1,0,0)               | AR(1) = 0.9309                           | None                  | 33.33      | -381.67             | 767.34   | Moderate fit, residuals show improvement but autocorrelations persist.     |
| ARIMA(1,0,1)               | AR(1) = 0.9705                           | MA(1) = -0.3204       | 29.64      | -374.72             | 755.44   | Good fit; residuals improved with moderate autocorrelation remaining.      |
| ARIMA(3,0,0)               | AR(1) = 0.5957, AR(2) = 0.3788, AR(3) = -0.0199 | None          | 28.87      | -373.19             | 754.38   | Slight improvement over simpler models, but no substantial residual gains. |
| ARIMA(2,0,0)               | AR(1) = 0.5887, AR(2) = 0.3669           | None                  | 28.88      | -373.21             | 752.43   | Good fit, residuals improved with lower sigmaÂ² and autocorrelations.       |
| **ARIMA(2,0,1)** (**Best Fit**) | AR(1) = 0.5441, AR(2) = 0.4084           | MA(1) = 0.0513        | 28.87      | -373.19             | **752.43** | **Best overall fit; residuals show minimal autocorrelations and high p-value for difference test.** |

ARIMA(2,0,1) is the best fit for the following reasons:

- **Lowest AIC (752.43)**: This value indicates the most efficient model, offering the best balance between fit and complexity.
- **Minimal Residual Autocorrelations**: The residual analysis shows no significant autocorrelations, supporting the model's adequacy.
- **Improved SigmaÂ²**: It has one of the lowest variance estimates, indicating superior error performance.

This model offers the optimal fit for the data, capturing dependencies while ensuring minimal error.

### Dynamic linear models

Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs) are state-space models that provide a flexible framework for modeling time series with complex structures. They accommodate time-varying trends, seasonality, and other features.

**Model Components**:

  - Trend: Modeled as a second-order polynomial.
  - Seasonality: Represented using Fourier terms or trigonometric functions.

```{r}
plot(time_series, main = "Monthly Sales (2015-2024)", ylab = "Sales", xlab = "Year",lw=2)
```

**Model Fit**: A dynamic linear model (DLM) is constructed to model the time series data. The model includes a second-order polynomial component to capture the trend and a trigonometric component with seasonal frequency (s=12) to account for monthly seasonality.

```{r}
build_sales = function(params) {
  dlmModPoly(order=2,dV=exp(params[1]),dW=exp(params[2:3]))+
  dlmModTrig(s=12,dV=0,dW=exp(rep(params[4],11)))
}
sales_fit = dlmMLE(time_series, parm=c(0,0,0,0), build=build_sales)
sales_fit$convergence
```

The model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) through the `dlmMLE` function, which converges successfully, as indicated by a convergence value of 0. 

```{r}
sales_mod = build_sales(sales_fit$par)
str(sales_mod)
```
This dynamic model effectively combines trend and seasonality components, providing a flexible framework for forecasting and understanding the time series behavior.

The dynamic linear model (DLM) is further refined by smoothing using the `dlmSmooth` function to estimate the trend and seasonal components.  

The smoothed results separate the observed sales data into:

- **Trend:** Capturing long-term movement.  

- **Seasonality:** Representing recurring monthly patterns.

The resulting plot as shown below highlights how the DLM effectively separates the observed sales data into its trend and seasonal components, offering deeper insights into the structure of the time series. (code shown below)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
png("sales_per_month_plot.png")
sales_smooth = dlmSmooth(time_series,sales_mod)
sales_level = sales_smooth$s[,1]

x = cbind(time_series, dropFirst(sales_smooth$s[,1]),
dropFirst(sales_smooth$s[,-(1:2)]) %*% t(sales_mod$FF)[-(1:2)])
colnames(x) = c("Production", "Trend", "Seasonal")
plot(x, type="o", main="DLM plot of Sales data (2015-2024)")
```

## Forecasting

### Forecast for January to June 2025

Forecasting sales using time series models involves analyzing historical sales data to predict future trends and patterns. For this analysis, SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Time-Series Regression, and Dynamic Linear Models (DLM) are utilized. Each method captures different aspects of the data, such as seasonality, trends, and potential structural changes. These techniques allow for robust predictions of future monthly sales, accompanied by 95% prediction intervals to account for uncertainty, providing valuable insights for planning and decision-making.

**ARIMA Forecast**

Using the SARIMA model configured as ARIMA(1,1,0)(0,1,1)[12], a sales forecast is generated for the period January to June 2025. This model effectively captures both the trend and seasonal patterns in the time series as discussed earlier. The six-month forecast includes predicted monthly sales along with 95% prediction intervals to account for uncertainty. The results illustrate the anticipated sales trajectory and seasonal variations for this period, as shown in the figure below, supporting future planning and decision-making. (see below code)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
forcast <- sarima.for(time_series , 6,1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12)
```

The forecasted values display a continued upward trend with seasonal fluctuations, and the 95% prediction intervals are calculated and plotted.

**Time-Series Regression Forecast**

Using a time-series regression approach, the forecast for monthly sales from January to June 2025 was generated by combining trend and seasonal components with residual adjustments. The model first extrapolates the trend for the forecasted months using the linear coefficients estimated from the regression. Seasonal effects, represented by the estimated seasonal coefficients, were added to the trend values to account for recurring patterns in the data. The residuals were then modeled using an ARIMA(2,0,0) process, and their predictions were incorporated to refine the forecast further.

The final forecasted values combine these three componentsâtrend, seasonality, and residual adjustmentsâproviding a more accurate prediction of future sales. Additionally, 95% prediction intervals were calculated to reflect the associated uncertainty, with upper and lower bounds generated using the forecast error.

```{r}
ar1 = arima(fit$resid,order=c(2,0,0))
ar1F = predict(ar1,n.ahead=6)
ar1F$pred = ts(ar1F$pred,start=c(2025,1),frequency=12)
```

```{r}
#This predicts the trend for the 6 next months
predictedTrend = fit$coef[1] + fit$coef[2]*(121:126)

#This predicts the seasonal effects within the same time  add more details about the magic
#numbers here
Seffects = c(0,fit$coef[3:7])

#and adds both components for a combined trend+seasonality forecast
predTS = predictedTrend + Seffects
```

```{r}
ar1FT = ar1F$pred + predTS
ar1F$se = ts(ar1F$se,start=c(2025,1),frequency=12)
ar1FTU = ar1FT + 2*ar1F$se
ar1FTL = ar1FT - 2*ar1F$se
```
The plot illustrates the historical time series along with the forecasted values, prediction intervals, and expected trajectory for the forecasted period. The forecasted sales, shown as a dashed red line, align closely with the observed trend and seasonality. The blue dashed lines represent the upper and lower 95% prediction intervals, capturing the range within which the actual values are likely to fall. This visualization shown below confirms that the model expects the upward trend to continue while retaining the seasonal fluctuations observed in historical data.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(time_series,xlim=c(2021,2026), lw=3)
lines(ar1FT,col=2,lty=2, lw=3)
lines(ar1FTU,col=4,lty=3, lw=2)
lines(ar1FTL,col=4,lty=3, lw=2)
```

#### Dynamic Linear Model Forecast

A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) was used to forecast sales for the next six months, providing point estimates and 95% prediction intervals. The forecasted values reflect the observed trend and seasonality, with prediction intervals offering bounds for potential variability.

```{r}
## Generate forecasts
sales_filt = dlmFilter(time_series, sales_mod)
sales_preds = dlmForecast(sales_filt, nAhead=6)
## Extract point forecasts and prediction interval limits
preds = sales_preds$f[,1]
lower = preds- 1.96 * sqrt(unlist(sales_preds$Q))
upper = preds + 1.96 * sqrt(unlist(sales_preds$Q))
```

The plot shows historical data (black), forecasts (red), and dashed red lines for prediction intervals, illustrating the expected sales trajectory and associated uncertainty (see below).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
sales_f = ts(c(time_series, upper), start=start(time_series),
frequency=frequency(time_series))
preds_f = ts(c(time_series[length(time_series)], preds), start=end(time_series),frequency=frequency(time_series))
## Plot data, forecasts and prediction intervals
plot(sales_f, col="red", ylab="sales production", type="n")
lines(time_series, col="black")
lines(preds_f, col="red")
lines(lower, lty=2, col="blue")
lines(upper, lty=2, col="blue")
legend("topleft", c("data", "forecasts", "95% prediction intervals"),
col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=c(1, 1, 2))
```

### Reliability of Forcasting

To evaluate the reliability of the forecasting methods, each model was trained on data from 2015 to 2023 (the first nine years), and forecasts were made for the subsequent twelve months (2024). The forecasts from the ARIMA, Time-Series Regression, and Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) were then compared to the actual observed values.

**Forcasting for the last 12 months Using  ARIMA**

The ARIMA model is used to forecast sales for the last 12 months (January to December 2024). The model is fitted on historical data from January 2015 to December 2023. The actual sales data (blue line) and the forecasted values are plotted for comparison, with the forecast covering the final 12 months. The graph below shows this comparison for verification.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
png("sales_per_month_plot.png", width = 600, height = 300)
sales_data <- ts(time_series[1:(length(time_series)-12)])
forecast <- sarima.for(sales_data, 12, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12)
lines(forecast$pred, col='red', lwd=2)
# Plot the actual time series
lines(ts(time_series[1:length(time_series)]), col='blue')
 
```

**Forcasting for the last 12 months Using Regression models**

A linear model is first fitted to the sales data from January 2015 to December 2023 to account for trend and seasonality. The residuals from this model are then used to fit an ARIMA(2,0,0) model. The forecast for January to December 2024 is obtained by combining the trend, seasonal effects, and ARIMA predictions, along with 95% prediction intervals. 

The graph below shows the actual sales data (black line), forecasted values (red line), and the 95% prediction intervals (blue dashed lines).

```{r}
# Use only the first 9 years (Jan 2015 - Dec 2023) for fitting the model
time = c(1:108)
season = factor(rep(1:12, 9))

# Fit a linear model to the time series (trend + seasonality)
fit1 = lm(time_series[1:108] ~ time + season)

# Fit an ARIMA model to the residuals of the linear model
ar11 = arima(fit1$resid, order=c(2,0,0))
ar11F = predict(ar11, n.ahead=12)
ar11F$pred = ts(ar11F$pred, start=c(2024, 1), frequency=12)

predictedTrend1 = fit1$coef[1] + fit1$coef[2]*(109:120)
Seffects1 = fit1$coef[3:14]  # The seasonal coefficients (12 months)
predTS1 = predictedTrend1 + Seffects1

# Combine the forecast with the trend and seasonal components
ar11FT = ar11F$pred + predTS1
ar11F$se = ts(ar11F$se, start=c(2024, 1), frequency=12)

ar11FTU = ar11FT + 2*ar11F$se  # Upper bound
ar11FTL = ar11FT - 2*ar11F$se  # Lower bound
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Plot the original data (Jan 2015 - Dec 2024), forecasted values, and prediction intervals
plot(time_series, xlim=c(2015, 2025), type='l', ylab='Sales', xlab='Time', col='black') 
lines(ar11FT, col=2, lwd = 2)
lines(ar11FTU, col=4, lty=2)
lines(ar11FTL, col=4, lty=2)
legend("topleft", c("Data", "Forecasted", "95% Prediction Intervals"), col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=c(1, 1, 2), lwd=c(1, 2, 1))
```

**Forcasting for the last 12 months Using DLM models**

In this analysis, a dynamic linear model (DLM) is used to forecast sales from January 2024 to December 2025 based on the data from January 2015 to December 2023. The model is fitted to the first 9 years of data, and forecasts are made for the next 12 months. The predicted values are combined with 95% prediction intervals to provide upper and lower bounds for the forecast.

The graph below displays the actual sales data (black line), the forecasted values (red line), and the 95% prediction intervals (blue dashed lines). The legend identifies these components to help interpret the plot.

```{r,echo=FALSE}

ARIMA had the lowest forecast error, demonstrating strong reliability for short-term predictions. The residual analysis showed minimal deviations, reinforcing its accuracy.

Time-Series Regression produced moderate forecast errors. While it captured trends well, its reliance on linear assumptions made it less robust for handling complex seasonal fluctuations.

DLM exhibited competitive performance, with slightly higher forecast errors than ARIMA but better adaptability to structural changes in the data.

To quantify reliability, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics were calculated for each model. ARIMA consistently showed the lowest error metrics, followed by DLM and regression.

### Visual Presentation

Comprehensive graphs were created to illustrate forecast performance:
  - **Forecast Plots**: Historical data (2015â2024) is overlaid with forecasted values for JanuaryâJune 2025, accompanied by 95% prediction intervals. These intervals help visualize the uncertainty associated with predictions.
  - **Reliability Assessment Plots**: Forecasts for 2024 (based on data from 2015â2023) are compared against actual sales. Residual plots and scatter plots of predicted versus actual values highlight model performance.
  - **Comparison Charts**: Side-by-side visualizations of ARIMA, regression, and DLM forecasts allow for easy comparison of trends, seasonal patterns, and prediction intervals.

These visual tools provide clear evidence of each model's ability to capture trends and seasonality, and their relative reliability in forecasting future values.

ARIMA is preferred for its ability to produce accurate forecasts with moderate complexity. It effectively captures the underlying patterns in time series data, making it suitable for generating reliable predictions in many cases.

Regression models, on the other hand, offer simplicity and ease of interpretation. While they provide useful insights into the relationships between variables, they tend to lack long-term reliability when dealing with more complex time series data. This limits their effectiveness for extended forecasting periods.

Dynamic Linear Models (DLM) offer greater flexibility and comparable accuracy to ARIMA but come at a higher computational cost. They can adapt to changing trends and incorporate various components, making them versatile for different forecasting scenarios, though they require more resources to implement effectively.

## Conclusions

Sales data show an upward trend accompanied by consistent seasonality. Both ARIMA and DLM models prove reliable for forecasting, with ARIMA offering better accuracy and being more suitable for operational use. Time-series regression, while useful for explanatory analysis, is less effective for long-term predictions due to its simplicity and limited ability to capture complex patterns.

**Recommendation**: Given its accuracy and computational efficiency, ARIMA is recommended for operational forecasting and planning.
